# Quick Weather ðŸŒ¤

Ever need to know what the weather's going to be like? Quick Weather is a straightforward little app that lets you check the forecast for any city. No bells and whistles, just the weather you're looking for.

## What You Get

You can see today's forecast, what tomorrow looks like, and a 3-day outlook. It's built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”nothing fancy, no framework bloat. If you're into that dark mode life, we've got a toggle for that too.

The app pulls its data from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in), which is honestly pretty reliable for this sort of thing.

## How to Use It

The design works great on your phone or desktop, so you're covered either way. Just head over to https://easyweather.free.nf, open it up in your browser, search for your city, and you're done.
